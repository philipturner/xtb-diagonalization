## 2026-10-20 — Phase 1 (all but the concurrency sweep)

- **Builds:** main (`68fe777`) and v6.7.1 against Accelerate with the swift-xtb / #1319 recipe (CMake, GCC 16,
  `BLA_VENDOR=Apple`, legacy LAPACK symbols), `scripts/build_xtb.sh`. Production turned out to be upstream main plus
  two GFN-FF file-I/O commits (fork `swift-xtb-2026` `8ea5fcd`), not v6.7.1: it already has the cached Cholesky.
- **Reproduction:** main build is bit-identical to `reference/` on all 174 single points (`scripts/compare.py`).
- **v6.7.1:** needs mctc-lib `77f65c6` and `-std=gnu17`; its gradients are wrong on axis-symmetric structures
  (compiler-dependent; fixed upstream in #1208/#1214) and its C API truncates the log (fixed in #1434). Timing use only.
- **Timers:** `xtb_scc_timer` on `diagonalization` (`db30346`) and `diag/timers-v6.7.1` (`bb9a2e5`), enabled by
  `XTB_SCC_TIMERS=<file>`; bit-identical results.
- **Measured (median of 5, 1 thread):** n = 412–448: 0.58–1.10 s per single point, eigensolve 12–14 ms per cycle =
  79–80% of a cycle and 56–69% of wall; n = 776: eigensolve 48% of wall, integral derivatives + gradient ~35%.
  Cached Cholesky (v6.7.1 → main) saves 1–4%. Profiles: `dsytrd` 27% and `dstedc` 20% of wall at n = 448.
- **Warm starts:** chained −35 to −55% SCC cycles, fixed seed −12 to −33%; all reach the cold solution, but the
  s12_C31 differences (≤ 1.2e-7 Eh, occupations 1.1e-3) already touch the Phase 3 gates: gates need a noise floor.
- **Pseudodiag:** disabled since before the public history (6.2 import, 2019); dead code since #192 (2020-05).
- **Not done:** concurrency sweep (H1): `mediaanalysisd` was using 70% of a core. Script ready: `scripts/sweep.py`.
- **Next:** run the sweep in a quiet window, finish `baseline.md`, then the user reviews before Phase 2.
